# Development Assumptions & Approach

- A Flask server would run locally on port 5000, serving a simple HTML page with "Yes" and "No" buttons
- The Claude AI, through the Anthropic API's computer_use tool, would be able to:
   - Take screenshots to analyze what's on the screen
   - Open the Firefox browser
   - Navigate to the localhost:5000 where our Flask server is running
   - Identify and click on interface elements (specifically the "Yes" button)
